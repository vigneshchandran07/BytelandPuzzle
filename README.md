Question : 

Byteland is a country which consists of n square-shaped plots of land arranged linearly.

Each plot has a different cost, measured in gold coins.

Mr.Roy, a property dealer in byteland was contacted by a big firm ‘Decima Technologies’ who are looking to buy a single large chunk of land for their upcoming project, subject to the following rules :

They will only pay a fixed cost of c gold coins per plot.

Mr. Roy can sell as many plots as he wants (including zero), but the plots should be consecutive ,i.e, only a single chunk of land without any gap is allowed.

You have to help Mr.Roy in selecting the plots so that his profit is maximized.

Given the cost of each plot of land, and the value of c, you have to print the maximum profit that can be generated by selling the plots.

Input Format

The first line of input is an integer t which is the number of test cases. t test cases follow each of which contains two lines of input:

The first line contains n and c (space-separated integers)

The second line contains n space-separated integers denoting price of each plot.

Output Format

For each test case, output, on a different line, a single integer T which is the maximum profit that can be made. If no profit can be 
made output 0.

Constraints

1 <= t <= 10^3

1 <= n <= 10^6

1 <= c <= 10^5

0 <= cost of plot <= 10^5
